# LetsCook

# Description
Let's Cook is the implementation for an app using which the users can search for recipes based on the ingredients they have. To make this functionality more usable, the customers can take a picture of the ingredients and the app will populate the ingredient list. Additionally, they can also choose their preferred cuisine. 

# Branches
There are two branches in our project.
1) The implementation which we tested using Ionic (Branch name: ionicImplementation)
